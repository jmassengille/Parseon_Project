# AI-Driven Security Analysis Approach

## Core Principles

1. **Semantic Understanding Over Pattern Matching**
   - Use embeddings and semantic analysis instead of exact pattern matching
   - Consider code context and relationships
   - Understand the meaning behind code patterns

2. **Context-Aware Analysis**
   - Analyze code in its full context (environment, data sensitivity, etc.)
   - Consider relationships between different code elements
   - Adapt analysis based on the specific context

3. **Dynamic Confidence Scoring**
   - Calculate confidence based on multiple factors:
     - Semantic similarity (40%)
     - Indicator matching (30%)
     - Context rules (30%)
   - Adjust for environmental factors
   - Never use hard-coded confidence scores

## Why Not Hard-Coded Pattern Matching?

1. **Limited Coverage**
   - Hard-coded patterns can't catch variations in code style
   - Misses semantically similar but syntactically different issues
   - Can't adapt to new security patterns

2. **False Positives/Negatives**
   - Exact matching leads to many false positives
   - Misses issues that don't match exact patterns
   - Can't understand context or intent

3. **Maintenance Issues**
   - Patterns need constant updates
   - Hard to maintain and extend
   - Can't learn from new examples

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Code Analysis**
   ```python
   # GOOD: Semantic analysis with context
   similarity = calculate_semantic_similarity(code, pattern)
   context_score = analyze_context(code, environment)
   confidence = calculate_dynamic_confidence(similarity, context_score)

   # BAD: Hard-coded pattern matching
   if pattern in code:
       confidence = 1.0
   ```

2. **Pattern Detection**
   ```python
   # GOOD: Context-aware pattern detection
   features = extract_semantic_features(code)
   indicators = check_semantic_indicators(features, pattern)
   context_rules = check_context_rules(code, pattern, context)

   # BAD: Direct pattern matching
   if re.search(pattern, code):
       return True
   ```

3. **Confidence Calculation**
   ```python
   # GOOD: Dynamic confidence calculation
   confidence = (
       similarity * 0.4 +
       indicator_match * 0.3 +
       context_match * 0.3
   ) * context_multiplier

   # BAD: Hard-coded confidence
   confidence = 1.0 if pattern in code else 0.0
   ```

## Required Components

1. **Semantic Analysis**
   - Must use embeddings for similarity matching
   - Consider code structure and relationships
   - Extract semantic features from code

2. **Context Awareness**
   - Analyze code in its environment
   - Consider data sensitivity
   - Look at relationships between components

3. **Dynamic Confidence**
   - Calculate confidence based on multiple factors
   - Adjust for context and environment
   - Never use fixed confidence scores

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't** use exact pattern matching for security analysis
2. **Don't** use hard-coded confidence scores
3. **Don't** ignore code context and relationships
4. **Don't** rely solely on regex patterns
5. **Don't** use fixed thresholds without context

## Best Practices

1. **Always** use semantic analysis for pattern matching
2. **Always** consider code context and relationships
3. **Always** calculate confidence dynamically
4. **Always** use multiple factors for analysis
5. **Always** adapt to the specific context

Remember: The goal is to understand the code's meaning and context, not just match patterns. This leads to more accurate and maintainable security analysis.
